## Project Summary

Vanity is a social media service for people to connect over shared interests in makeup and skincare and discover new products. We primarily target users of beauty products and provide two main features —

1. A product reviews feature that enables users to look up specific products and read or write reviews by customers who previously purchased the product
2. A social media service that enables users to connect with friends and view each other’s “makeup bags” — in effect to see which specific products their friends purchased.

Currently, there exists no form of online app (besides general purpose apps like Instagram) for the makeup and skincare community to connect. Our web application aims to address this need.
